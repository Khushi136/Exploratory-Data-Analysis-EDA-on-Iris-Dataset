## Project Description
This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset to gain insights into its characteristics and relationships between features. Leveraging Python and essential data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn's PCA module, we visualize patterns, distributions, correlations, and perform dimensionality reduction within the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (including PCA)
- Jupyter Notebook

## What You'll Learn:
Through this project, you'll develop proficiency in data visualization, basic data manipulation using Pandas, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA using Scikit-learn. By exploring the Iris dataset, you'll gain practical experience in analyzing real-world data, identifying trends, and communicating insights through visualizations.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle's UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable indicating the species of iris.

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset was downloaded in its original form and loaded directly into the analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) using Pandas for further exploration and analysis.
